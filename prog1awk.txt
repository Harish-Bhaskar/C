Step2: Open text editor, type the below program and save with extention .awk (prog1.awk ) 
BEGIN { 
dcount = 0; 
rcount = 0; 
} 
{ 
event = $1; 
if(event == "d") 
{ 
dcount++; 
} 
if(event == "r") 
{ 
rcount++; 
} 
} 
END { 
printf("The no.of packets dropped : %d\n ",dcount); 
printf("The no.of packets recieved : %d\n ",rcount); 
}


Step 5: After simulation is completed run awk file to see the output , 
[root@localhost~]# awk â€“f prog1.awk prog1.tr 
Number of packets droped = 16 
Step 6: To see the trace file contents open the file as , 
[root@localhost~]# vi prog1.tr
