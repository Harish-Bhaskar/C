Step2: Open text editor, type the below program and save with extention .awk (prog3.awk ) 
BEGIN { 
count=0; 
} 
{ 
event=$1; 
if(event=="d") 
{ 
count++; 
} 
} 
END { 
printf("No of packets dropped : %d\n",count); 
} 




Step3: Run the simulation program 
[root@localhost~]# ns prog3.tcl 
(Here “ns” indicates network simulator. We get the topology shown in the snapshot.)


Step 4: Now press the play button in the simulation window and the simulation will begins. 
Step 5: After simulation is completed run awk file to see the output , 
[root@localhost~]# awk –f prog3.awk prog3.tr 
Step 6: To see the trace file contents open the file as , 
[root@localhost~]# vi prog3.tr
